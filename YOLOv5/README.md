- Optimized for performance using C++ programming language
- Supports multiple input sources such as video files and JPG

## Requirements
- C++17 compatible compiler
- OpenCV 4.x
- CUDA 11.0+ (optional for GPU acceleration)

## Usage
To run the YOLOv5 object detector on a video file:
```
cmake ../YOLOv5/
make
./opencv
```
Run each step to after cloned
